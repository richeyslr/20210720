    <p>Hi, my name is Spencer Richey. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama on December 11, 1996. My family moved to Memphis when I was 4 years old, so I basically grew up in Memphis. When I was in 1st grade, my friend's mom picked our carpool group up from school, and took us to our first group tennis lesson. I didn't really know why we were there, but I was having a lot of fun. Fast forward 11 years to my senior year of high school, and I stuck with my roots and commited to play tennis at the University of Alabama. At Alabama, I was putting all of my energy and effort into improving at tennis, and while I acheived moderate success on the court, I lost sight of the importance of improving my future. I was coasting in school and taking classes I had no interest in just to post a grade so I could to the courts and focus on playing tennis. During my sophomore year, I had a slump in terms of my tennis results. I began getting into arguments with our coaches, not showing up to class, and breaking team rules ;). I needed to break this cycle. I was no longer happy at Alabama and took the next year off school and tennis completely, working as a tennis coach. After that year, I got a call from the tennis coach at the University of Dayton asking if I was interested in playing for their team. I was itching to play competitive tennis again, but I knew I would be rusty. I went to the University of Dayton for a year, but for many of the same reasons I fell back into the same cycle of letting my tennis results control my mental well-being. So again, I came back to Memphis and got a job as a cook at Restaurant Iris in midtown Memphis and kept teaching tennis lessons. After a year of isolated introspection, strange working environments, and discovery of new passions, I am here and enrolled in this course with a new perspective. I am here to set new goals, accomplish those goals, and continue to create new goals knowing and realizing that process is laying the foundation for my future!. </p>
